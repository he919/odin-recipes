        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1 inch chunks</li>
            <li>salt and fresh cracked pepper</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons flour </li>
            <li>vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Lake-town's finest red wine</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 large potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 inch chunks</li>
            <li>4 carrots, peeled and cut into 1 inch chunks</li>
            <li>2 celery stalks, cut into 1 inch chunks</li>
            <li>5 cremini mushrooms, chopped</li>
            <li>half an onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>chopped parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, season the meat liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons of flour toss to coat.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet with a few tablespoons of vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Add the meat and cook, stirring occasionally to brown on all sides.</li>
            <li>Once meat is brown, remove to the slow cooker</li>
            <li>Add potatoes, carrots, celery, mushrooms, onion, garlic and thyme on top of the meat.</li>
            <li>In the skillet, deglaze the pan with wine.</li>
            <li>Add 2 more tablespoons of flour and stir - it will seem like a thick paste.</li>
            <li>Add beef broth and heat until slightly thickened (lumps of flour are ok, they'll cook out in the slow cooker).</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper, add to the slow cooker, and give everything a good stir.</li>
            <li>Cook on low for 8 hours.  When ready to eat, taste and adjust salt and pepper as needed, and mix in some fresh chopped parsley.</li>
            <li>Serve with some crusty bread and a pint of Barliman's Best.</li>
        </ol>
