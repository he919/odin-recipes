        <p><em>"Give them this" said Gandalf, searching in his pack and drawing out a leathern flask. "Just a mouthful each, for all of us. It is very precious. It is miruvor, the cordial of Imladris. Elrond gave it to me at our parting. Pass it round!"</em></p>
        <p><em>As soon as Frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor he felt a new strength of heart, and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs. The others also revived and found fresh hope and vigor. But the snow did not relent.</em></p>

        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>350ml mead</li>
            <li>2 strips lemon peel</li>
            <li>2 strips orange peel</li>
            <li>1/2 cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>1 tbsp dried rose buds for tea</li>
            <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
            <li> edible flowers</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small pot, combine your mead, orange and lemon peel, cinnamon stick, honey, and rose buds.</li>
            <li>Heat on low-medium heat until it just comes to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat, strain, and garnish with food grade petals</li>
            <li>Variation: Remove the mead and replace with water or green tea.  Increase the honey to 2-3 tbsp and add 2 tbsp of lemon juice.</li>
